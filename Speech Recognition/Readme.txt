An audio file is read by the code and divided into frequency bands. Each band is passed through bandpass filter, half-wave rectification and lowpass filter (cutoff frequenciesL:16Hz, 50Hz, 160Hz and 500 Hz). The result is the envelope of the original audio signal. The envelope is modulated with white noise and passed through the original bandpass filter. The resultant signals of the bands are combined to produce one final signal. This signal is amplified and presented to listeners as an audiofile.
This experiment is to determine the difference in the speech recognition when the original signal is passed through lowpass filters of different cutoff frequencies(16,50,160,500 Hz).
